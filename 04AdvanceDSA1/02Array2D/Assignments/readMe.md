Problem Description

Given a 2D Matrix A of dimensions N*N, we need to return the sum of all possible submatrices.



Problem Constraints

1 <= N <=30

0 <= A[i][j] <= 10



Input Format

Single argument representing a 2-D array A of size N x N.



Output Format

Return an integer denoting the sum of all possible submatrices in the given matrix.



Example Input

Input 1:
A = [ [1, 1]
      [1, 1] ]
Input 2:
A = [ [1, 2]
      [3, 4] ]


Example Output

Output 1:
16
Output 2:
40


Example Explanation

Example 1:
Number of submatrices with 1 elements = 4, so sum of all such submatrices = 4 * 1 = 4
Number of submatrices with 2 elements = 4, so sum of all such submatrices = 4 * 2 = 8
Number of submatrices with 3 elements = 0
Number of submatrices with 4 elements = 1, so sum of such submatrix = 4
Total Sum = 4+8+4 = 16
Example 2:
The submatrices are [1], [2], [3], [4], [1, 2], [3, 4], [1, 3], [2, 4] and [[1, 2], [3, 4]].
Total sum = 40

Problem Description

Given a matrix of integers A of size N x M and multiple queries Q, for each query, find and return the submatrix sum.




Inputs to queries are top left (b, c) and bottom right (d, e) indexes of submatrix whose sum is to find out.

NOTE:

Rows are numbered from top to bottom, and columns are numbered from left to right.
The sum may be large, so return the answer mod 109 + 7.
Also, select the data type carefully, if you want to store the addition of some elements.
Indexing given in B, C, D, and E arrays is 1-based.
Top Left 0-based index = (B[i] - 1, C[i] - 1)
Bottom Right 0-based index = (D[i] - 1, E[i] - 1)




Problem Constraints

1 <= N, M <= 1000
-100000 <= A[i] <= 100000
1 <= Q <= 100000
1 <= B[i] <= D[i] <= N
1 <= C[i] <= E[i] <= M



Input Format

The first argument given is the integer matrix A.
The second argument given is the integer array B.
The third argument given is the integer array C.
The fourth argument given is the integer array D.
The fifth argument given is the integer array E.
(B[i], C[i]) represents the top left corner of the i'th query.
(D[i], E[i]) represents the bottom right corner of the i'th query.



Output Format

Return an integer array containing the submatrix sum for each query.



Example Input

Input 1:

 A = [   [1, 2, 3]
         [4, 5, 6]
         [7, 8, 9]   ]
 B = [1, 2]
 C = [1, 2]
 D = [2, 3]
 E = [2, 3]
Input 2:

 A = [   [5, 17, 100, 11]
         [0, 0,  2,   8]    ]
 B = [1, 1]
 C = [1, 4]
 D = [2, 2]
 E = [2, 4]


Example Output

Output 1:

 [12, 28]
Output 2:

 [22, 19]


Example Explanation

Explanation 1:

 For query 1: Submatrix contains elements: 1, 2, 4 and 5. So, their sum is 12.
 For query 2: Submatrix contains elements: 5, 6, 8 and 9. So, their sum is 28.
Explanation 2:

 For query 1: Submatrix contains elements: 5, 17, 0 and 0. So, their sum is 22.
 For query 2: Submatrix contains elements: 11 and 8. So, their sum is 19.

Problem Description

Given a matrix of integers A of size N x M and an integer B.

In the given matrix every row and column is sorted in non-decreasing order. Find and return the position of B in the matrix in the given form:
If A[i][j] = B then return (i * 1009 + j)
If B is not present return -1.

Note 1: Rows are numbered from top to bottom and columns are numbered from left to right.
Note 2: If there are multiple B in A then return the smallest value of i*1009 +j such that A[i][j]=B.
Note 3: Expected time complexity is linear
Note 4: Use 1-based indexing


Problem Constraints

1 <= N, M <= 1000
-100000 <= A[i] <= 100000
-100000 <= B <= 100000


Input Format

The first argument given is the integer matrix A.
The second argument given is the integer B.


Output Format

Return the position of B and if it is not present in A return -1 instead.


Example Input

Input 1:-
A = [[1, 2, 3]
     [4, 5, 6]
     [7, 8, 9]]
B = 2
Input 2:-
A = [[1, 2]
     [3, 3]]
B = 3


Example Output

Output 1:-
1011
Output 2:-
2019


Example Explanation

Expanation 1:-
A[1][2] = 2
1 * 1009 + 2 = 1011
Explanation 2:-
A[2][1] = 3
2 * 1009 + 1 = 2019
A[2][2] = 3
2 * 1009 + 2 = 2020
The minimum value is 2019

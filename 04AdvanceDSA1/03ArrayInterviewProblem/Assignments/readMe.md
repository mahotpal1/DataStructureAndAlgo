Problem Description

You have a set of non-overlapping intervals. You are given a new interval [start, end], insert this new interval into the set of intervals (merge if necessary).

You may assume that the intervals were initially sorted according to their start times.



Problem Constraints

0 <= |intervals| <= 105



Input Format

First argument is the vector of intervals

second argument is the new interval to be merged



Output Format

Return the vector of intervals after merging



Example Input

Input 1:

Given intervals [1, 3], [6, 9] insert and merge [2, 5] .
Input 2:

Given intervals [1, 3], [6, 9] insert and merge [2, 6] .


Example Output

Output 1:

 [ [1, 5], [6, 9] ]
Output 2:

 [ [1, 9] ]


Example Explanation

Explanation 1:

(2,5) does not completely merge the given intervals
Explanation 2:

(2,6) completely merges the given intervals

Use Hint
Problem Description

Given a collection of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals.



Problem Constraints

1 <= Total number of intervals <= 100000.



Input Format

First argument is a list of intervals.



Output Format

Return the sorted list of intervals after merging all the overlapping intervals.



Example Input

Input 1:

[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]


Example Output

Output 1:

[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]


Example Explanation

Explanation 1:

Merge intervals [1,3] and [2,6] -> [1,6].
so, the required answer after merging is [1,6],[8,10],[15,18].
No more overlapping intervals present.

Use Hint
Problem Description

Given an unsorted integer array, A of size N. Find the first missing positive integer.





Note: Your algorithm should run in O(n) time and use constant space.







Problem Constraints

1 <= N <= 1000000

-109 <= A[i] <= 109



Input Format

First argument is an integer array A.



Output Format

Return an integer denoting the first missing positive integer.



Example Input

Input 1:

[1, 2, 0]
Input 2:

[3, 4, -1, 1]
Input 3:

[-8, -7, -6]






Example Output

Output 1:

3
Output 2:

2
Output 3:

1






Example Explanation

Explanation 1:

A = [1, 2, 0]
First positive integer missing from the array is 3.
Explanation 2:

A = [3, 4, -1, 1]
First positive integer missing from the array is 2.
Explanation 3:

A = [-8, -7, -6]
First positive integer missing from the array is 1.

Use Hint
Problem Description

Imagine a histogram where the bars' heights are given by the array A. Each bar is of uniform width, which is 1 unit. When it rains, water will accumulate in the valleys between the bars.

Your task is to calculate the total amount of water that can be trapped in these valleys.

Example:

The Array A = [5, 4, 1, 4, 3, 2, 7] is visualized as below. The total amount of rain water trapped in A is 11.


Rain Water Trapped




Problem Constraints

1 <= |A| <= 105
0 <= A[i] <= 105



Input Format

First and only argument is the Integer Array, A.



Output Format

Return an Integer, denoting the total amount of water that can be trapped in these valleys



Example Input

Input 1:

 A = [0, 1, 0, 2]
Input 2:

A = [1, 2]


Example Output

Output 1:

1
Output 2:

0

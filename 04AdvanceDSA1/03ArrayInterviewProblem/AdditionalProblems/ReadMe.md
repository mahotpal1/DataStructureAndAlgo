Problem Description

Implement the next permutation, which rearranges numbers into the numerically next greater permutation of numbers for a given array A of size N.



If such arrangement is not possible, it must be rearranged as the lowest possible order, i.e., sorted in ascending order.

NOTE:



The replacement must be in-place, do not allocate extra memory.
DO NOT USE LIBRARY FUNCTION FOR NEXT PERMUTATION. Use of Library functions will disqualify your submission retroactively and will give you penalty points.


Problem Constraints

1 <= N <= 5 * 105

1 <= A[i] <= 109



Input Format

The first and the only argument of input has an array of integers, A.



Output Format

Return an array of integers, representing the next permutation of the given array.



Example Input

Input 1:

 A = [1, 2, 3]
Input 2:

 A = [3, 2, 1]


Example Output

Output 1:

 [1, 3, 2]
Output 2:

 [1, 2, 3]


Example Explanation

Explanation 1:

 Next permutaion of [1, 2, 3] will be [1, 3, 2].
Explanation 2:

 No arrangement is possible such that the number are arranged into the numerically next greater permutation of numbers.
 So will rearranges it in the lowest possible order.

Problem Description

Given an integer A, find and return the total number of digit 1 appearing in all non-negative integers less than or equal to A.



Problem Constraints

0 <= A <= 109



Input Format

The only argument given is the integer A.



Output Format

Return the total number of digit 1 appearing in all non-negative integers less than or equal to A.



Example Input

Input 1:

 A = 10
Input 2:

 A = 11


Example Output

Output 1:

 2
Output 2:

 4


Example Explanation

Explanation 1:

Digit 1 appears in 1 and 10 only and appears one time in each. So the answer is 2.
Explanation 2:

Digit 1 appears in 1(1 time) , 10(1 time) and 11(2 times) only. So the answer is 4.

Problem Description

Given N bags, each bag contains Bi chocolates. There is a kid and a magician.
In a unit of time, the kid can choose any bag i, and eat Bi chocolates from it, then the magician will fill the ith bag with floor(Bi/2) chocolates.






Find the maximum number of chocolates that the kid can eat in A units of time.

NOTE:

floor() function returns the largest integer less than or equal to a given number.
Return your answer modulo 109+7








Problem Constraints

1 <= N <= 100000
0 <= B[i] <= INT_MAX
0 <= A <= 105



Input Format

The first argument is an integer A.
The second argument is an integer array B of size N.



Output Format

Return an integer denoting the maximum number of chocolates the kid can eat in A units of time.



Example Input

Input 1:

 A = 3
 B = [6, 5]
Input 2:

 A = 5
 b = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]


Example Output

Output 1:

 14

Example Explanation

Explanation 1:

 At t = 1 kid eats 6 chocolates from bag 0, and the bag gets filled by 3 chocolates. 
 At t = 2 kid eats 5 chocolates from bag 1, and the bag gets filled by 2 chocolates. 
 At t = 3 kid eats 3 chocolates from bag 0, and the bag gets filled by 1 chocolate. 
 so, total number of chocolates eaten are 6 + 5 + 3 = 14

Problem Description

You are given an array A of integers that represent the lengths of ropes.




You need to connect these ropes into one rope. The cost of joining two ropes equals the sum of their lengths.

Find and return the minimum cost to connect these ropes into one rope.






Problem Constraints

1 <= length of the array <= 100000
1 <= A[i] <= 1000



Input Format

The only argument given is the integer array A.



Output Format

Return an integer denoting the minimum cost to connect these ropes into one rope.



Example Input

Input 1:

 A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Input 2:

 A = [5, 17, 100, 11]


Example Output

Output 1:

 33
Output 2:

 182


Example Explanation

Explanation 1:

 Given array A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
 Connect the ropes in the following manner:
 1 + 2 = 3
 3 + 3 = 6
 4 + 5 = 9
 6 + 9 = 15

 So, total cost  to connect the ropes into one is 3 + 6 + 9 + 15 = 33.
Explanation 2:

 Given array A = [5, 17, 100, 11].
 Connect the ropes in the following manner:
 5 + 11 = 16
 16 + 17 = 33
 33 + 100 = 133

 So, total cost  to connect the ropes into one is 16 + 33 + 133 = 182.

Solved

Use Hint
Problem Description

You are developing a feature for Zomato that helps users find the nearest restaurants to their current location. It uses GPS to determine the user's location and has access to a database of restaurants, each with its own set of coordinates in a two-dimensional space representing their geographical location on a map. The goal is to identify the "B" closest restaurants to the user, providing a quick and convenient way to choose where to eat.

Given a list of restaurant locations, denoted by A (each represented by its x and y coordinates on a map), and an integer B representing the number of closest restaurants to the user. The user's current location is assumed to be at the origin (0, 0).

Here, the distance between two points on a plane is the Euclidean distance.

You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in.)

NOTE: Euclidean distance between two points P1(x1, y1) and P2(x2, y2) is sqrt( (x1-x2)2 + (y1-y2)2).


Problem Constraints

1 <= B <= length of the list A <= 105
-105 <= A[i][0] <= 105
-105 <= A[i][1] <= 105



Input Format

The argument given is list A and an integer B.



Output Format

Return the B closest points to the origin (0, 0) in any order.



Example Input

Input 1:

 A = [ 
       [1, 3],
       [-2, 2] 
     ]
 B = 1
Input 2:

 A = [
       [1, -1],
       [2, -1]
     ] 
 B = 1


Example Output

Output 1:

 [ [-2, 2] ]
Output 2:

 [ [1, -1] ]


Example Explanation

Explanation 1:

 The Euclidean distance will be sqrt(10) for point [1,3] and sqrt(8) for point [-2,2].
 So one closest point will be [-2,2].
Explanation 2:

 The Euclidean distance will be sqrt(2) for point [1,-1] and sqrt(5) for point [2,-1].
 So one closest point will be [1,-1].

Problem Description

Misha loves eating candies. She has been given N boxes of Candies.


She decides that every time she will choose a box having the minimum number of candies, eat half of the candies and put the remaining candies in the other box that has the minimum number of candies.
Misha does not like a box if it has the number of candies greater than B so she won't eat from that box. Can you find how many candies she will eat?

NOTE 1: If a box has an odd number of candies then Misha will eat the floor(odd / 2).

NOTE 2: The same box will not be chosen again.




Problem Constraints

1 <= N <= 105

1 <= A[i] <= 105

1 <= B <= 106



Input Format

The first argument is A an Array of Integers, where A[i] is the number of candies in the ith box.
The second argument is B, the maximum number of candies Misha like in a box.



Output Format

Return an integer denoting the number of candies Misha will eat.



Example Input

Input 1:


 A = [3, 2, 3]
 B = 4
Input 2:

 A = [1, 2, 1]
 B = 2



Example Output

Output 1:

 2
Output 2:

 1


Example Explanation

Explanation 1:

 1st time Misha will eat from 2nd box, i.e 1 candy she'll eat and will put the remaining 1 candy in the 1st box.
 2nd time she will eat from the 3rd box, i.e 1 candy she'll eat and will put the remaining 2 candies in the 1st box.
 She will not eat from the 3rd box as now it has candies greater than B.
 So the number of candies Misha eat is 2.
Explanation 2:

 1st time Misha will eat from 1st box, i.e she can't eat any and will put the remaining 1 candy in the 3rd box.
 2nd time she will eat from the 3rd box, i.e 1 candy she'll eat and will put the remaining 1 candies in the 2nd box.
 She will not eat from the 2nd box as now it has candies greater than B.
 So the number of candies Misha eat is 1.

Problem Description

Given an array of integers A and an integer B. You must modify the array exactly B number of times. In a single modification, we can replace any one array element A[i] by -A[i].

 B = 10


Example Output

Output 1:

Example Explanation

Explanation 1:

 
Operation 1: Make -29 to 29,
Operation 2: Make -9 to 9,
Operation 3: Make 9 to -9,
Operation 4: Make -68 to 68.
Thus, the final array after 4 modifications = [24, 68, 29, -9, 84]

 For i = 2, ans = -1
 For i = 3, ans = 1 * 2 * 3 = 6
 For i = 4, ans = 2 * 3 * 4 = 24
 For i = 5, ans = 3 * 4 * 5 = 60

 So, the output is [-1, -1, 6, 24, 60].
 
Explanation 2:

 For i = 1, ans = -1
 For i = 2, ans = -1
 For i = 3, ans = 10 * 2 * 13 = 260
 For i = 4, ans = 10 * 13 * 4 = 520

 So, the output is [-1, -1, 260, 520].

Problem Description

Given a binary search tree represented by root A, write a function to find the Bth smallest element in the tree.



Problem Constraints

1 <= Number of nodes in binary tree <= 100000

0 <= node values <= 10^9



Input Format

First and only argument is head of the binary tree A.



Output Format

Return an integer, representing the Bth element.



Example Input

Input 1:

 
            2
          /   \
         1    3
B = 2

Use Hint
Problem Description

Two elements of a Binary Search Tree (BST), represented by root A are swapped by mistake. Tell us the 2 values, when swapped, will restore the Binary Search Tree (BST).

A solution using O(n) space is pretty straightforward. Could you devise a constant space solution?

Note: The 2 values must be returned in ascending order



Problem Constraints

1 <= size of tree <= 100000



Input Format

First and only argument is the head of the tree,A



Output Format

Return the 2 elements which need to be swapped.



Example Input

Input 1:

         1 
        / \ 
       2   3
Input 2:

 
         2
        / \
       3   1



Example Output

Output 1:

 [2, 1]
Output 2:

 [3, 1]

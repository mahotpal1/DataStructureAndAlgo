Problem Description

Given a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from left to right, level by level).



Problem Constraints

1 <= number of nodes <= 105



Input Format

First and only argument is root node of the binary tree, A.



Output Format

Return a 2D integer array denoting the level order traversal of the given binary tree.

Use Hint
Problem Description

Given a binary tree of integers denoted by root A. Return an array of integers representing the right view of the Binary tree.

Right view of a Binary Tree is a set of nodes visible when the tree is visited from Right side.



Problem Constraints

1 <= Number of nodes in binary tree <= 100000

0 <= node values <= 10^9



Input Format

First and only argument is head of the binary tree A.



Output Format

Return an array, representing the right view of the binary tree.

Use Hint
Problem Description

Given a binary tree, return a 2-D array with vertical order traversal of it. Go through the example and image for more details.


NOTE: If 2 Tree Nodes shares the same vertical level then the one with lesser depth will come first.



Problem Constraints

0 <= number of nodes <= 105



Input Format

First and only arument is a pointer to the root node of binary tree, A.



Output Format

Return a 2D array denoting the vertical order traversal of tree as shown.

Use Hint
Problem Description

Given a root of binary tree A, determine if it is height-balanced.

A height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.



Problem Constraints

1 <= size of tree <= 100000



Input Format

First and only argument is the root of the tree A.



Output Format

Return 0 / 1 ( 0 for false, 1 for true ) for this problem.
